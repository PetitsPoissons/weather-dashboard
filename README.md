# Weather Dashboard
This weather dashboard runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS.
Users either enter a city or click on a city displayed from their search history. The weather data is retrieved from the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api). `localStorage` is used to store persistent data.
